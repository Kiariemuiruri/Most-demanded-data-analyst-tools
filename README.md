# Most-demanded-data-analysis-tools
 
 This project is built by creating a data pipeline that collects data of job posts from timesjobs.com.
 Data is collected by use of a web scrap code and then links the data to jupyter notebook for analysis.
 
 ## Reproducible code
 The web scrap program runs automatically after one day and the data is stored in a 'txt' file.
 Jupyter code runs with a single click giving an analysis update of the new data at the end of the week.
 
 This analysis is important in the following ways:
 + Guides individuals who want to start a profession in data analytics on which skills to acquire first.
 + Organizations in need od a data analyst can know which qualifications to check while hiring.
